Glory to God in the highest 
and peace to His people on earth. 
Lord God, heavenly king, 
almighty, God, and Father. 
We worship You, we give You thanks, 
we praise You for your Glory.
Lord Jesus Chris, 
only son of the Father, 
Lord God, Lamb of God, 
You take away the sins of the world, 
have mercy on us. 
You are seated at the right end of the Father,
 have mercy on us. 
For You alone are the Holy one, 
You alone are the Lord,
You alone after the most high, Jesus Christ, 
with the Holy Spirit in the glory of God, the Father. 
Amen, Amen
